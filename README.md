# Collaborative-Movie-Recommendation-System
Implement the collaborative filtering learning algorithm and apply it to a dataset of movie ratings. The goal of a collaborative filtering recommender system is to generate two vectors: For each user, a 'parameter vector' that embodies the movie tastes of a user. For each movie, a feature vector of the same size which embodies some description of the movie. 
The dot product of the two vectors plus the bias term should produce an estimate of the rating the user might give to that movie.

The data set is derived from the MovieLens "ml-latest-small" dataset.
